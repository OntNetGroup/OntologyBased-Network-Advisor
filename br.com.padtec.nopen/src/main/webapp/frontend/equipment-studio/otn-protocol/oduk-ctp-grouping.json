				"This attribute indicates the positions of the TCM 
				and GCC processing functions within the ODUk TP.
				The order of the position in the positionSeq 
				attribute together with the signal flow determine 
				the processing sequence of the TCM and GCC functions 
				within the ODUk TP. Once the positions are 
				determined, the signal processing sequence will 
				follow the signal flow for each direction of the 
				signal.
				Within the ODUk_CTP, the position order is going 
				from adaptation to connection function. Within the 
				ODUk_TTP, the order is going from connection to 
				adaptation function.
				The syntax of the PositionSeq attribute will be a 
				SEQUENCE OF pointers, which point to the contained 
				TCM and GCC function.
				The order of TCM and GCC access function in the 
				positionSeq attribute is significant only when there 
				are more than one TCM functions within the ODUk TP 
				and also at least one of them have the 
				TimActDisabled attribute set to FALSE (i.e. AIS is 
				inserted upon TIM).
				If a GCC12_TP is contained in an ODUk_TTP and the 
				GCC12_TP is not listed in the PositionSeq attribute 
				of the ODUk_TTP, then the GCC access is at the AP 
				side of the ODUk TT function.
