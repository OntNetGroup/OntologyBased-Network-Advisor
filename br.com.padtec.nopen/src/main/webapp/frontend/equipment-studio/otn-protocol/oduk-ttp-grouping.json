				Within the ODUk_CTP, the position order is going

				adaptation function.

				positionSeq attribute is significant only when there 
				are more than one TCM functions within the ODUk TP 
				and also at least one of them have the 
				TimActDisabled attribute set to FALSE (i.e. AIS is 
				inserted upon TIM).

				of the ODUk_TTP, then the GCC access is at the AP
